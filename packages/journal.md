		- follower resize on desktop must readjust to the pivot origin
		- when changing followers, adjust to the minimum size
	- todo
		- remove ui in mini mode, add floating controls when interacting with the mini player
		- when there is no available follower, default to the url mode

	- ✔️ follower + observer
		- locate the target
		- once it's visible, start the destruction observer
		- style the target
		- create the portalFollower and set it follow the target
		- once the target is destroyed, unlink the portalFollower
	- bugs
		- ◻ the follower/resize fails to constrain the to its max/min size
		- ◻ the last follower pointer target should increase in z-index
		- ◻ the resize stops when the mouse leaves the window
			- ◻ added rect mode to constraint to a parent element
			- now when the resize tracker is on the edge of the parent, it becomes sluggish and sometimes it overflows it anyway
			- the tracker and the mouse fall out of sync when entering the 'too small' branch
		- the controls component should listen for keyboard events only when it's active/allowed
		- when there are two followers on top of each other, it's hard to know the hidden one is there
		- sometimes the page's scroll wheel is blocked when the mouse is over the follower
		- there's a lot of white space when two notionLinks/blocks are nested
		- the follower/target causes a layout shift when it's created if the user is scrolling upwards (the page jumps down)
		- when placing two notionLinks on the same block/text
			- the second one doesn't work, plus it looses its pointerTarget function
			- there's a lot of white space when two notionLinks are on the same block
			- when they share urls, the second one is kinda useless, but when the urls are different, the first one shrinks to the size of the actual notionLink url font size
			- when dividing the block into two, it creates a new follower fo the second half but the old one the one that wasn't working is still there
			- when there's nothing else but the notionLink in a block, it's almost impossible to edit the text
	- todo
		- add a button to turn off the follower
		- the follower pointer should highlight the available target(s)
		- the follower is jerky when using the mouse wheel but when using the html scroll thumb it's smooth
		- option for the follower to scale the target appropriately when on resize observers (only when shrinking)
		- since the follower overlays the target, when the user focuses to edit the block, move the caret to the ends of the target text
		- find a better way to calculate the follower rect size when overlaying with other dom elements
			- maybe provide a list of foreground elements to check against
		- notionLinks apps don't know how to destroy themselves
		- notionLinks apps should be able to create their own followers
			- specially if another notion client deletes the block/link element
